    <h2>Your Eyes</h2>
    <p>
      I fall for your eyes everyday. I love your eyes.  
      Your eyes seem to provide a comfort place, love that I was always craving for,  
      love that I didn’t deserve.  
      Your eyes show me the value of me, the love that makes me the richest man on earth.

    <h2>Your Behaviour</h2>
    <p>
      You are just like me. You show me love that I always wanted to see.  
      You make me feel important. You prioritise me over everything just like me.  
      For me, love is over everything and I feel that love from you.

    <h2>Your Love for Me</h2>
    <p>
      You loving me for past 10 years or so…  
      I don’t really care about your past.  
      I know whatever happened was because of me, because of you trying to move on from me.  
      But I was always important for you, you always loved me.
      You showed what true love can do.
      You showed that love shown in movies is not false but the right depiction of true love.
      You are awesome. You showed me the true meaning of love and patience.

    <h2>You & My Family</h2>
    <p>
      You know my family. You are Jain. You are of my caste.
      And most importantly, I know you will do anything to keep me and my family happy.
      You will keep my mom happy, you will keep my father happy.
      You will be like an angel who keeps everyone happy.
      That is one of the most important things for me, and you are doing that.

    <h2>You Give Me Motivation</h2>
    <p>
      I want to live for you. I want to achieve something for you.
      I want to give all the love that I ever have to you.
      I want to keep you smiling, solve all your problems,
      give you the princess treatment, and never ever make you regret choosing me.
      I want to cover you in love, luxury, comfort, and happiness.
      You give me the motivation to do all that.

    <h2>My Future Is You</h2>
    <p>
      I see a future with you.
      I want to marry you, have a family with you,
      visit places all over the world and see everything together.
      I cannot imagine a single day without you.
      All I imagine is you and me, us together.

    <h2>You</h2>
    <p>
      Apart from everything, I love your body.
      Your V, your boobs, your ass, your waist, your stomach, your neck, your face — everything.
      I can never unlove your body nor you.
      I don’t want to feel anyone else but you.
      All I do is wait to feel you again.
