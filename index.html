  <h2>Your Eyes</h2>
  <p class="typing">
I fall for your eyes everyday. I love your eyes.
Your eyes feel like comfort, the love I always craved,
the love I didn’t deserve.
Your eyes show me my value,
the love that makes me the richest man on earth.

  <p>
You are just like me.
You make me feel important.
You prioritise me over everything.
For me love is everything,
and I feel that love from you.
